# LOMO: LOw-Memory Optimization
This is the implementation for [Full Parameter Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models with Limited Resorcces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09782.pdf).

## Run the code
```shell
bash run.sh
```

## Reproduce our results
We provide the sampled datasets used in our experiments [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zV7sXvU7YHKWyS3fYV0yyi7FyTjIpEuO?usp=sharing). Due to the limited computational resources, we reported the highest results obtained from experiments conducted with the same random seed (`42`). We acknolwedge this limitation in our work and plan to conduct repeated experiments in the next version to address it.
